  The MB-339 was developed during the 1970s in response to an Italian Air Force requirement that sought a replacement
  for the service's existing fleet of Aermacchi MB-326s. Its design was derived from that of the MB-326, rather than
  a new design, and thus the two aircraft share considerable similarities in terms of their design. Aermacchi had
  found that the MB-339 was capable of satisfying all of the specified requirements while being the most affordable
  option available. The maiden flight of the MB-339 took place on 12 August 1976; the first production aircraft were
  delivered two years later.
